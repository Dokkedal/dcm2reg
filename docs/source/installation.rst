Installation
*************

``dcm2reg`` can be installed via ``pip`` using the following command in a terminal::

    pip install git+https://github.com/Dokkedal/dcm2reg

This will currently install all functions, scripts, tutorials and even a copy of
the documentation files. The documentation itself cannot be built without an
installation of ``Sphinx``, however you can always find it at https://dokkedal-dcm2reg.readthedocs.io.

To update your installation of the package, the above installation command can be
run again. If there is an available update, ``pip`` will handle it for you.

..
    Version that decides whether an update is available is given by setup.py.
