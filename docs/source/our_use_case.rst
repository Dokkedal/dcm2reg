Original use case
******************

Our data 
========

* Visual examples - different scans - Philip
* Levels - color code - Philip
* Additional information - Jonathan
* Delineation in RTSTRUCT - Jonathan
* Noise e.g. table - Philip
* Limitations - very heterogenous data - Busch

Our pipeline and the big picture
================================

* Preprocessing - conversion, registration, Evaluation - Philip
* Model development - neural network, comparison (CT vs CT+MR) - Busch 
* Model usage - implementation, user acceptance - Busch
* Flowchart - Jonathan 


Challenges and solutions
========================

* Missing header information in conversion - code example - Jonathan
* Many edge cases e.g. missing secondary study - Jonathan
* A lot of data and therefore slow running - solved in conversion by splitting process. - Jonathan
* Noise limiting use of thresholding - Philip
* Thresholding based on change in pixel value turned out to be not possible - Philip
* Different MR's have different colors - Philip
* Field difficulty and lack of documentation - Busch
* Excel cell character limit - Jonathan
